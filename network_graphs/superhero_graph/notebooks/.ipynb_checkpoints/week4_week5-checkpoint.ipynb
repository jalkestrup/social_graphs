    "Some of the character names & associated wiki links seem odd, the char name does not seem to match the url. This is for example the case for the char \"Vectron\" that has the wiki url \"Elseworld's Finest: Supergirl & Batgirl#Secondary characters and cameos\", and \"Van'n Intraktus, Magaan\" that has the wikilink \"Green Lantern Corps#First attempt of rebuilding the Green Lantern Corps\". This seem to arise from the situation when a wiki page contains a char links for certain character, that does not have their own wiki page, but instead is directed to another page that mention this char. Many of these incidens seem to arise from the page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DC_Comics_characters:_V  where we have a list of links from character names, to wikilinks that are not specfically describing the character.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we select what our csv believe is a character page, that in some cases may lead to a more general page, and we then download the content of this page and find wikilinks, and then create connections based on what we interpreted as a specific character based on that, we will end up creating a lot of connections to eg. 'Vectron', although the links was in fact just leading to the Green Lantern Corpse. \n",

    "As an example the above problem has linked the char Val Colby to the 'Lex Luthor#Relationships and family' wiki, and the consequence of the above is that the network think that Val Colby with the wikilink 'Lex Luthor#Relationships and family' has 32 connections, whereas in fact it has 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem is that the vissible wiki link (2nd part) is not nescesarily the name of the char, fx. \"Doctor Fate|Fate\" \"Doctor Fate\" and \"Doctor Fate|Nabu\" all appear as internal links, linking to the same wiki page. Hence the vissible link is sometimes showed as just Fate for short, and for another completely different reference, Nabu, links to the Doctor Fate page. For that reason it is better to stick to the WikiUrls that are unique. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most robust method is therefore to discard characters that does not seem to have their own specific page, before creating links from their wiki. Another method could be to create the character if mentioned, but not create any links based on the wiki-page if the wikipage does not seem to represent that specific character, but that would simply lead to isolated nodes as a character with no \"legitimate\" character wiki-page, would have no inbound or outbound leads.

A theory could for example be that there exist a lot of links between avenger characters, originally Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye (both movie and comics), and that in a somewhat seperate community the most connected character, Spider-man, has some groupings of his own. Untill 2015 the movie rights for Spiderman was solely Sony's and therefor Spiderman did not appear in any avenger/marvel movies, potentieally limiting the amount of links to other marvel movie characters historically speaking. It could also be that it is another sub-community of super heroes.."

    "With 429 in-nodes it is quite difficult to come up with a general description of what 'relation' the neighbors to Spider-man has, however, it can be seen that clearly that majority of in-links are coming from other marvel characters (429 vs 8). It is also clear that all top 10 nodes in terms of in-link are main characters and all but Doctor Doom are somewhat \"good guys\", the heroes & central characters. It makes sense that the most in-linked characters are those that by common intution is the most popular, as most pages even less known superheroes&villains will with a higher probability link to the main protagonist."

It appears that wikipages of villians or side character have relatively more outwards references than their super-hero counterwarts. Generally links that point outwards from a wikipedia page is created when external 'knowledge' is needed to explain a concept, one hypoythesis could be that the core content of many main protagonists are explained by their \"own\" story where it is less relevant to link to external characters, whereas villains and sidekicks only exist by nature of their connection to other characters. The story of villains and sidekicks is more about their role in relation to other characters, hence they have a bigger need to use outlinks for referencing."
